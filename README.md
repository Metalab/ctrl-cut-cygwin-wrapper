- Compile `ctrl-cut.bat` using the [Bat To Exe Converter](http://www.f2ko.de/programs.php?pid=b2e)

You can now use the Inkscape extension as described [here](https://github.com/Metalab/ctrl-cut-inkscape/blob/master/README.md).  
Additionally, you can run Ctrl-Cut from the command line: `ctrl-cut [file]`.
